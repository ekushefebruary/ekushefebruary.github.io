						<p>The rituals of wedding in Bengali marriage is vast and enriched with different activities involving auspiciousness, religious sentiments and fun. A typical marriage starts with 'gaaye holud' early in the morning of the day of marriage. It's equivalent to the 'haldi' observed in marriages of other communities.</p>

<p>Holud or turmeric is sent from both groom's and bride's house to each other's place. At the beginning of the ritual, it's applied on the skin. The starting of this practice probably took place due to the fact that turmeric has capabilities of curing skin diseases and also has antioxidant properties. 
Both bride and groom take baths after turmeric gets dried off. </p>

<p>Then both the bride and groom get ready; and the groom leaves early as he has to come to bride's place. The people who accompanies the groom while he's coming are called borjaatri (bor = groom, jaatri = passengers).</p>

<p>After the groom arrives at the bride's place; the wedding starts. Usually the wedding follows an auspicious timing based on the positions of heavenly bodies in indian astrology. This timing is called logno. In olden days if the wedding gets called off after scheduling, the bride was ridiculed because she missed the auspicious timing. Such girls were called Lagnabhrastaa. Good that we went past those times.</p>

<p>Before the event of marriage starts, the groom and bride are not allowed to see each other. While guests start to come, they greet both the bride and groom separately and hand over gifts and exchange pleasantries. Just like anywhere else in the world, weddings are also a great place to socialise here.</p> 

<p>The actual event of wedding is a religious event which needs a priest, a Brahmin to be there. One Brahmin from each house remains present in the whole exercise to ensure everything is in place.</p>
