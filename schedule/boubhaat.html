This means celebrating the first time the bou (wife) has rice (bhat, the staple food) in the groom's house, where she's supposed to live for the rest of her life. The groom's family welcomes the bride as one of their own. Come, stay with us, new family member. You're one of the clan now, you're another partner in the conjugal crime.</p>

						<p>The day before boubhaat, ie. the day after the marriage, the bride comes to the groom's place. This day is basically a resting day for both the players, as the night before was long and sleepless, and also the next day is going to be the same.</p>

						<p>When the bride enters the house, people welcome her with a tray of plesenteries. This tray is called Daala. And the whole process is called boron. The boron-daala comprises of some rice, wishing her abundance of food, some grass, wishing abundance of land, and also a burning pradip, wishing a healthy and happy life. It also has some vermillion (sindur), wishing a long and happy married life (basically saying she dies before her husband, so that she does not have to live the miserable life of a widow, without the beloved fishes, clothes and jewellery). </p>
